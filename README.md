# Cluster-ATM-withdrawal-behaviors-to-detect-unusual-activity.
Welcome to the repository for Clustering Methods and Financial Insights. This project explores three popular clustering algorithms—K-Means, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)—to analyze transactional data, withdrawals specifically and derive actionable business decisions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Project Overview**

This repository provides an end-to-end implementation of clustering techniques on financial datasets to identify distinct patterns of behavior and anomalies. The clustering outcomes serve as a foundation for business decision-making, including risk management, fraud detection, and customer segmentation.

**Clustering Techniques Used**

K-Means Clustering:
Partitions the dataset into a predefined number of clusters using a centroid-based approach.
Suitable for identifying well-separated groups in transactional data.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):
Identifies clusters based on the density of points in the feature space.
Effectively detects noise and anomalies, making it ideal for fraud detection.

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):
A probabilistic clustering algorithm that assigns probabilities to data points for belonging to multiple clusters.
Handles overlapping clusters and offers nuanced insights into financial data.

**Fallout**

Anomaly Detection (DBSCAN):
Identify high-risk or potentially fraudulent transactions by analyzing noise points.
Use outlier insights to bolster risk mitigation strategies in financial processes.

Customer Segmentation (K-Means):
Segment customers into high-value and low-value groups for targeted marketing strategies.
Separate routine transactions from outliers, helping refine operational processes.

Behavioral Insights (GMM):
Understand overlapping behaviors, such as customers transitioning between high-risk and stable activities.
Use probabilistic cluster assignments to enhance decision-making in credit scoring and personalized offerings.
